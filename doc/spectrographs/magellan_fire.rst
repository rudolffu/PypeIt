Magellan FIRE

Overview
========

This file summarizes several instrument specific
items for the Magellan/FIRE spectrograph.


Echelle slit edges
++++++++++++++++++

The slit edges could shift up to several pixels during the night when you
observe a target for a long time and/or when you changing setups during
the night.  Therefore, we strongly encourage the observers to take some flat
fields right after your science exposures every few hours.

Echelle wavelength calibration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

PypeIt uses sky OH line for the wavelength calibrations.
So you do not need the ThAr calibrations when reducing your
Magellan/FIRE Echelle data with PypeIt.
