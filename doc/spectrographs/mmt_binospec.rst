Overview
========

This file summarizes several instrument specific
items for the MMTO's Binospec spectrograph.

Wavelength Calibration
++++++++++++++++++++++

Templates were created in 2023 that cover the usable range for each of the 3 gratings. Only the bluest part of the
1000 l/mm grating's range isn't fully covered by the template, but there should be sufficient overlap for the template
to still work at the bluest settings, e.g. a central wavelength of 4000 A. Better test data is needed to confirm this.

Bad pixel mask
++++++++++++++

The bad pixels were identified from flat and bias observations taken in
2019 and need to be verified.
