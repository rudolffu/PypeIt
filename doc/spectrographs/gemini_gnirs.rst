Overview
========

This file summarizes several instrument specific
items for the Gemini/GNIRS spectrograph.


Wavelength calibration
++++++++++++++++++++++

We recommend using sky OH lines for the wavelength calibration (i.e., set your
science frames as ``arc`` and ``tilt`` frames, as well).  So you can ignore the
default Gemini Arc calibrations when reducing your Gemini/GNIRS data with
PypeIt.
