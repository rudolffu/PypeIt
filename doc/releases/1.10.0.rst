Version 1.10.0
==============

Major Changes
-------------

- Refactor PypeIt input files. Main pypeit file remains the same, except
  that inclusion of leading and trailing | characters in the data table
  (required in previous versions) will now result in
  DeprecationWarnings. All post-processing scripts (coadding, fluxing,
  etc) must use the new format. See the main documentation pages.

- Apply find_min_max when clipping the image for object finding
- Mask bad detector regions for global sky flexure calculation
- Added wavelength diagnostics to the spec2d output

Instrument-specific Changes/Improvements

- Modify tweak_standard for Keck-MOSFIRE/J2
- Detector structure correction included in flatfield calibration
  (Keck-KCWI only)
