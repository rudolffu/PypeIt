Version 1.7.0
=============

Major Changes
-------------

- MOSFIRE improvements:
  - improved frame typing

  - ingestion of slitmask metadata for MOSFIRE with association of extracted
    spectra to object name and coordinates

  - extraction of undetected objects

  - incorporates dither pattern from file headers

- Implements new Mark4 detector for Keck/LRISr; selected as the
  keck_lris_red_mark4 "spectrograph"

Minor Changes
-------------

- Introduces pypeit_parse_calib_id script
- Throw a warning if the chosen spectrograph has a header which does not
  match expectation
- Pypeit can now read (currently for Keck DEIMOS only) the list of arc
  lamps from the header and use it for wavelength calibration.
- Allow one to restrict the wavelength range of the arxiv template
- Set DEIMOS FWHM default to 10 pixels
- Fixed a bug in HolyGrail that did not allow for sigdetect and
  rms_wavelength to be slit dependent lists
