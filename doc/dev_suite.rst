========================
PypeIt Development Suite
========================

We have compiled a large suite of data from all instruments supported by
``PypeIt``.  These data are used to test that ``PypeIt`` is successful for *all*
instruments *anytime* new features are developed.  In fact, spectrographs that
are designated as "supported" for PypeIt data reduction (see :ref:`instruments`)
*must* include data in our development suite for integration testing.
All data in the DevSuite are hosted in a `Shared Google Drive
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oh19siB1-F0jjmY-F_jr73eA-TQYEiFW?usp=sharing>`__,
and the code used to perform the tests is isolated to its own git repository
`here <https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt-development-suite>`__.

**If you are new to PypeIt, you are encouraged to pull example data from the
DevSuite for your instrument when learning how to use the software.**

The following is an exact copy of the README file from the
`PypeIt-Development-Suite GitHub repository
<https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt-development-suite>`__.
