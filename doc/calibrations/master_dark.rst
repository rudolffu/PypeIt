MasterDark
==========

Overview
========

This file describes the data model for the ``MasterDark`` image.
This is written to disk as a multi-extension FITS file prefixed by
``MasterDark`` in the ``Masters/`` folder.

This is generally a simple combination of all input dark frames.

Inspecting
==========

The first extension is the stacked image.  You can view it with
any standard image viewer, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

    ginga Masters/MasterDark_A_1_01.fits

It should resemble any one of your input dark frames aside from:

- Having been overscan subtracted (depending on the processing parameters)

- Having been bias subtracted (depending on the processing parameters)

- Being only a trimmed portion of the image

- Re-oriented so that vertical is the spectral dimension with blue at the bottom

Trouble Shooting
================

If your image appears to be in error, here are the things to consider:

 - Is one or more of your input dark frames junk?

 - Is one or more of your input dark frames mis-labeled?

Current DarkImage Data Model
============================

Internally, the image is held in
:class:`~pypeit.images.buildimage.DarkImage`,
which subclasses from :class:`~pypeit.images.pypeitimage.PypeItImage` and
:class:`~pypeit.datamodel.DataContainer`.
The datamodel written to disk is:
